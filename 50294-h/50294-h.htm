<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>No one is satisfied with an incomplete story.
The very meagre and inconsistent accounts of
the adventures of Sylvia and Rachel Hall
(familiarly known as the “Hall girls”) heretofore
published, merely excited one’s curiosity to
know the whole story. The ladies’ statements
that have been published, gave only an outline
of the facts as far as they knew them personally.
To obtain all the facts, required much investigation
of books and a great deal of correspondence
with historical societies, editors of
newspapers and the War and the Interior Department
of the United States. Also, the writer
has had personal interviews with relatives of
the Misses Hall, and has traveled over the
ground and examined all the evidence that now
appears from the location of the little cottage
on Indian Creek to Galena where the girls took
a boat for St. Louis.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. Miranda Dunavan, a daughter of
Mrs. Rachel Hall Munson (the younger captive),
gave me the family history of her mother;
and Miss Sylvia E. Horn of Lincoln, Nebraska,
and Mr. C. L. Horn of Mackinaw, Illinois.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
grand-children of Mrs. Sylvia Hall Horn (the
elder captive), contributed the history of the
Horn family. Thus every fact in the following
pages is stated upon the best evidence.</p>

<p>To gather all the traditions that still linger
along the course over which the Indians traveled
with their captives, the writer enlisted the
services of his nieces, Miss Gertrude Scanlan
of Fennimore, Wisconsin, and Miss Marian
Scanlan of Prairie du Chien, whose grandfathers
were pioneers in the lead regions. However,
no fact has been stated on tradition without
the clues being verified by land records or
government documents.</p>

<p>Of course every lady wants to know how the
girls looked. Unfortunately, there is no picture
of either of them prior to middle life. Mrs.
Dunavan lent to me a very rare daguerreotype
picture of her mother, Mrs. Munson, taken at
the age of about forty-two years, and a photograph
of her aunt, Mrs. Sylvia Hall Horn, taken
when she was over sixty years of age. Also,
I borrowed from Mrs. Dunavan a tintype picture
of herself when she was sixteen, which is
said to be a very good likeness of her aunt
Sylvia at the time that she was taken captive.
These pictures are reproduced herein. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
tradition of the neighborhood is that the girls
were unusually handsome in both figure and
face and of captivating kind dispositions. They
were born in Kentucky and carried with them
to Illinois the southern culture which has won
for the ladies of the South considerable fame in
story and song.</p>

<span class="large">DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY.</span></h2>

<p>In its natural condition, perhaps no more attractive
country ever laid before the eyes of
man than that in which occurred the incidents
of the following narrative. On the south it is
bordered by the Illinois river, with its historical
events beginning with the old Kaskaskia Mission
established by Father Marquette in 1673
amidst the most beautiful scenery in the whole
state of Illinois, which is now included in
Starved Rock State Park.</p>

<p>What memories cluster around old Kaskaskia!
As the first capital of Illinois, it was visited
by Gen. La Fayette and Presidents Jackson,
Lincoln, Taylor and Harrison; by Jefferson
Davis, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnson, and by
nearly every other man who was prominent in
United States history prior to 1837, when
Springfield became the state capital.</p>

<p>On the east for more than one hundred miles
the Fox river, with its source in a beautiful
lake near Waukesha, Wisconsin, flows south
into the Illinois at Ottawa. Westward the great
prairie stretches off to and beyond the Rock
river which has eroded a narrow valley through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
that otherwise flat plain. Besides Rock river
the only important streams that lay in the
course of travel of the Hall girls as prisoners,
were the Sycamore (South Kishwaukee) and
the Kishwaukee in Illinois, and Turtle Creek,
the Bark River and the Oconomowoc in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>We are told by geologists that during the
quaternary age of the world, a great ice-berg,
moving down from the north, crushed all the
trees and vegetation in its path, leveled most
of the hills and filled most of the valleys as far
south as the Ohio River. When that body of ice
melted it formed lakes in the depressions which
were not filled with till. Drumlins, eskers and
kames, here and there, remain to indicate either
the resistance of the prior formation or that
quantities of earth filled the uneven under surface
of the ice at the time of its dissolution.</p>

<p>By the action of the atmosphere, rains and
dew, as centuries rolled on, vegetation sprang
up all over that great plain, and springs to supply
the greatest necessity of living things, broke
forth and flowed in streams that united into
rivers as they rolled on to the sea. Along the
streams were forests of trees&mdash;including many
species of the oak, ash, sycamore, elm, sugar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
maple, locust, hickory, walnut, butternut, linden,
cherry, buckeye, blackberry and many
other familiar varieties. Also, here and there
stood groves that escaped the terrible prairie
fires that almost every year swept over that
vast plain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A PRAIRIE FIRE&mdash;MC KENNEY.</p>
</div>

<p>Game of many kinds, from the monstrous buffalo
and timid deer down to the rabbit, the turkey,
the prairie chicken, and the quail, was
abundant.</p>

<p>Last, and by no means least, was the beautiful
flora of that country which was known as
“The Paradise of the West.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> A traveler who
saw it in its natural condition, describes it as
follows: “Above all countries, this is the land
of flowers. In the season, every prairie is an
immense flower garden. In the early stages of
spring flowers, the prevalent tint is peach bluish;
the next is a deeper red; then succeeds the
yellow; and to the latest period of autumn the
prairies exhibit a brilliant golden, scarlet and
blue carpet, mingled with the green and brown
ripened grass.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<span class="large">INDIAN TROUBLES.</span></h2>

<p>When the first white man settled in Illinois,
the Mascoutin Indians occupied the lands between
the Illinois River and the waterway
formed by the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers from
Green Bay to Prairie du Chien. Later the Sacs,
the Foxes, and the Pottawatamies, occupied the
territory and had many villages. There were
no national boundary lines. A prominent route
of travel was the Kishwaukee Trail from Watseca
in Eastern Illinois up the Kankakee to
where it flows into the Illinois, and thence in
a northwesterly direction to the mouth of the
Kishwaukee on Rock River, about six miles below
Rockford. Dixon was the great center of
trails. The principal one was from Kaskaskia
by way of Dixon to Galena, Illinois. Numerous
other trails connected prominent points and
various Indian villages.</p>

<p>In 1804 a treaty was made with the Sacs and
Foxes at St. Louis, of which the principal provision
were as follows:</p>

<p>“Article 1. The United States receive the
united Sac and Fox tribes into their friendship
and protection and the said tribes agree to consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
themselves under the protection of the
United States, and no other power whatsoever.</p>

<p>“Article 2. The General boundary line between
the land of the United States and the said
Indian tribes shall be as follows, to-wit: Beginning
at a point on the Missouri River opposite
to the mouth of the Gasconde River; thence,
in a direct course so as to strike the River Jeffreon
to the Mississippi; thence, up the Mississippi
to the mouth of the Ouisconsing [Wisconsin]
River, and up the same to a point which
shall be 36 miles in a direct line from the mouth
of the said river, thence, by a direct line to the
point where the Fox River (a branch of the
Illinois) leaves the small lake called Sakaegan;
thence, down the Fox River to the Illinois
River, and down the same to the Mississippi.
And the said tribes, for and in consideration of
the friendship and protection of the United
States, which is now extended to them, of the
goods (to the value of two thousand two hundred
and thirty-four dollars and fifty cents)
which are now delivered, and of the annuity
hereinafter stipulated to be paid, do hereby
cede and relinquish forever, to the United
States, all the lands included within the above
described boundary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>“Article 3. In consideration of the cession
and relinquishment of land made in the preceding
article, the United States will deliver to the
said tribes, at the town of St. Louis, or some
other convenient place on the Mississippi, yearly
and every year, goods suited to the circumstances
of the Indians of the value of one thousand
dollars (six hundred of which are intended
for the Sacs and four hundred for the Foxes),
reckoning that value at the first cost of the
goods in the City or place in the United States,
where they shall be procured. And if the said
tribes shall hereafter at an annual delivery of
the goods aforesaid, desire that a part of their
annuity should be furnished in domestic animals,
implements of husbandry, and other utensils,
convenient for them, or in compensation to
useful artificers, who may reside with or near
them, and be employed for their benefit, the
same shall, at the subsequent annual delivery,
be furnished accordingly.</p>

<p>“Article 4. The United States will never interrupt
the said tribes in the possession of the
lands, which they rightfully claim, but will, on
the contrary, protect them in the quiet enjoyment
of the same against their own citizens and
against all other white persons, who may intrude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
upon them. And the said tribes do hereby
engage that they will never sell their lands,
or any part thereof, to any sovereign power but
the United States, nor to the citizens or subjects
of any other sovereign power, nor to the citizens
of the United States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Article 7. As long as the lands which are
now ceded to the United States remain their
[U. S.] property, the Indians belonging to the
said tribes shall enjoy the privileges of living
and hunting upon them.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">3</a>
“Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties”, 174.</p></div>

<p>The Chippewas, the Winnebagos, and the
Pottawatamies, made claim to the same territory.
Even the Foxes and Sacs claimed that
the young chiefs who signed the treaty, were
made drunk, and while in that condition agreed
to the treaty.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Also, the Indians maintained
that the United States would not allow them to
hunt upon the “wild” lands, notwithstanding
Art. 7 of the treaty and that the title thereto
was still in the government. Therefore, the Indians
refused to ratify the treaty, and the idea
that they were grievously wronged became a
fixed notion in the minds of the old chiefs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
which led to the Red Bird War of 1827, and the
still greater Black Hawk War in 1832.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p class="caption">BLACK HAWK AS A WARRIOR.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Black Hawk had fought with the English in
the War of 1812, and by reason of the defeat of
the English, including his own, he retained his
natural desire for revenge against the Americans.
He was born at Rock Island, and had as
strong love for his native place as was ever retained
by any white man. When Illinois became
a state in 1818, Black Hawk with all his
people was ordered to move across the Mississippi
into Iowa, which he reluctantly obeyed.
However, he was never satisfied with his new
location, and in 1832 he again crossed the Mississippi
with four hundred warriors and all
their squaws and children and squatted on his
former possessions at Rock Island. He was
ordered back to Iowa, but refused to go until
he learned that troops were being sent against
him. With all his people he retired north along
Rock River, followed by the Illinois militia,
and when he reached a point about twenty-five
miles south of Rockford, he halted and held a
council of war with chiefs of the Pottawatomies
and Winnebagoes, where he delivered the following
speech:</p>

<p>“I was born at the Sac Village, and here I
spent my childhood, youth and manhood. I
liked to look on this place with its surroundings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
of big rivers, shady groves and green prairies.
Here are the graves of my father and some of
my children. Here I expected to live and die
and lay my bones beside those near and dear
to me; but now in my old age I have been
driven from my home, and dare not look again
upon this loved spot.”</p>

<p>The old chief choked with grief and tears
flowed down his cheeks. Covering his face in
his blanket, he remained silent for a few moments.
Then wiping away his tears, he continued:</p>

<p>“Before many moons you, too, will be compelled
to leave your homes. The haunts of your
youth, your villages, your corn fields, and your
hunting grounds, will be in the possession of
the whites, and by them the graves of your
fathers will be plowed up, while your people
will be retreating towards the setting sun to
find new homes beyond the Father of Waters.
We have been as brothers; we fought side by
side in the British war; we hunted together and
slept under the same blanket; we have met at
councils and at religious feasts; our people are
alike and our interests are the same.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>On the 14th day of May, 1832, the militia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
under Major Stillman arrived within eight miles
of the camp of Black Hawk who sent three
Indians under a flag of truce to negotiate a
treaty with the whites. The wily chief also
sent five other Indians to a point where they
could watch the unarmed braves carrying the
white flag. Stillman’s men refusing to recognize
the white flag set upon the Indians, killed
one and captured the others, and then set off
after the other five who held their guns crosswise
over their heads as a sign of friendship.
The whites killed two of the five and chased
the others into Black Hawk’s camp. Then the
Indians set upon Stillman’s army, cut it to
pieces, and chased the scattered remnants for
many miles. The place of that battle is known
as “Stillman’s Run.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The disgrace of the entire
affair has been a dark blot upon the white
man’s bravery and his manner of dealing with
the Indians. Up to this time the Indians had
committed no crime nor act of war against the
whites.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the engagement Black
Hawk called another council of his braves, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
which it was determined to fight to the last and
to send out small bands of Indians to the various
white settlements to destroy them. Among
the great warriors present at that council was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the celebrated Chief Shabona (Shab-eh-ney)<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
who fought beside Tecumseh at his down-fall at
the battle of the Thames. Shabona pleaded
with the Indian chiefs to give up the war and
to return to Iowa, and when they refused to do
so, he, his son Pypagee, and his nephew Pyps,
mounted ponies and rode to the various white
settlements and notified the people of the danger
of the Indians. The first horse with which
Shabona started, dropped dead under him;
but he obtained another horse from a farmer
and rode day and night until he had warned
the whites at all the settlements.</p>

<span class="large">THE DAVIS SETTLEMENT.</span></h2>

<p>The father of our heroines, William Hall,
who was born in Georgia, migrated to Kentucky
where he married Mary J. Wilburs, and
in 1825 emigrated to Mackinaw, about fifteen
miles south of Peoria, Illinois, where he opened
a farm. Shortly afterwards he moved to the
lead mines near Galena where he staid three
years, and then returned to Lamoille, Bureau
County, Illinois. In the spring of 1832 he sold
out his mining claim and settled upon a homestead
about two miles east of the farm of William
Davis. Prior to that time his oldest
daughter, Temperance, had been married to
Peter Cartwright, but the other members of his
family, consisting of his wife, three daughters&mdash;Sylvia,
aged 19, Rachel, aged 17, and Elizabeth,
aged 8 years, and two boys, were living
with him. Some time prior to the massacre,
two Indians named Co-mee and To-qua-mee,
who had been frequent visitors at the Hall
home and treated kindly by Mr. Hall’s daughters,
endeavored, after the custom of the Indians,
to purchase Sylvia and Rachel from their
father.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The Halls were noted for their hospitality.

was the guest of the family one night in April
1832.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>William Pettigrew, also from Kentucky, who
had just migrated to the Davis Settlement and
had not yet established a home for himself, with
his wife and two children, was temporarily
stopping at the home of Mr. Davis at the time
of the massacre.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>In 1830, John H. Henderson emigrated from
Tennessee to Indian Creek and settled on a
homestead adjoining the land of Davis on the
south. Subsequently the Hendersons became
prominent politicians, both in Illinois and Iowa.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1830, William Davis, a Kentuckian,
and a blacksmith by trade, settled on
a land claim on Big Indian Creek, twelve miles
north of Ottawa, in the northern part of La
Salle County, Illinois. He was the first white
settler at that place.</p>

<p>Agriculture and marriage have always been
the great necessities to found permanent civilization.
To establish a settlement in the great
west, at that time, a blacksmith shop and a mill
were the next two great necessities, and around
those the early settlers broke up the wild prairie
and on the upturned sod sowed buckwheat, turnips
and sod-corn, which within three months
produced their first food from the soil for themselves
and their stock. To “break” the tough
prairie sod required a sharp plowshare and colter,
which had to be resharpened frequently.
Without the blacksmith the prairie could hardly
be cultivated. The big ox-teams of the neighbors,
with which they had moved into the country,
pulled the plow. Next, with the crop produced,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the grist mill to grind the grain was a
great necessity. The Indians and some of the
early settlers with hammers and stones pulverized
corn and wheat enough to supply their absolute
wants from day to day, but the whites,
who had been accustomed to corn-meal and
wheat-flour bread, were not satisfied with the
mashed product. Therefore, Davis, who supplied
both of those great necessities, was a
prominent man in the Davis Settlement.</p>

<p>The mill-site was where the Sauk trail from
Black Hawk’s Village at the mouth of the Rock
River crossed Big Indian Creek and continued
thence east to Canada, where the whole tribe
of Sacs went every year to get their annuities
from the English Government.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Just above the
ford the creek meandered through a flat-bottomed
gulch that was about two hundred feet
wide with precipitous banks about fifteen feet
high. At this point the stream flowed southeasterly
and was fringed along its course with
woods that grew dense, and here and there expanded
into groves, but at other places there
were openings where the prairie fires annually
destroyed the undergrowth and left standing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
only the monarchs of the forest. The north
bank of the gulch had an incline of about forty-five
degrees to the level of the prairie. On that
bank in a sparsely timbered opening from which
the prairie stretched off to the cardinal points
of the compass, William Davis located his home
and erected his cabin. About that cabin there
were trees that produced fruit, fuel and lumber,
among whose branches were singing birds
of great variety, including the Cardinal, the
Dickcissel, the Carolina Wren, the Thrush and
the Robin. By May the bank was covered with
a carpet of thick, waving grass, diversified with
ever-changing colored flowers, until the cruel
frost of Fall destroyed them. It was an
idyllic spot. No doubt Davis hoped that some
day the Davis Settlement would become Davis
City, and that his generations would revel in
mansions that would replace the cottage on the
bank of that new Jordan, where he, like King
David, in his old age might kneel among his
people to pray.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the hopes and aspirations of the
Davis family were soon to be blasted. Davis
was a powerful man and his Kentucky blood
fairly boiled with resentment at any offense,
particularly one given by an Indian, upon whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
he looked as an inferior. With his gun and
bowie knife Davis would fight a dozen Indians&mdash;aye,
a score. It seemed as though he could
play with them in the air as an athlete plays
with Indian clubs.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty feet south of
his cottage, Davis erected a blacksmith shop
and a mill. To obtain water power for his mill
it became necessary for Davis to put a dam
across the stream. Six miles farther up Indian
Creek there was an Indian village, and as the
fish naturally went up the stream every spring,
there was good fishing at the village for the
Indians. The dam prevented the fish from going
up, and the Indians protested against this
invasion of their rights. Davis, however, insisted
on his rights to build and maintain the
dam, and bad feelings were engendered.</p>

<p>One day in April, 1832, Davis discovered an
Indian tearing an outlet in the dam, and with
a hickory stick he beat the Indian unmercifully.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
Had he killed the Indian it might have
ended the affair; but to whip an Indian with a
stick as you would whip a dog, was an insult
that incurred the resentment of the whole Indian
village, and instilled in the Indian a rankling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
desire for revenge. The incident, however,
was settled by Chief Shabona with the assistance
of another Indian chief named Waubansee,
who advised the Indians not to resort to forceful
reparation and to do their fishing below the
dam. The Indians followed Shabona’s advice
for some time, but after a while Davis noticed
that they ceased to go below the dam to fish,
and being quite familiar with the Indian character,
he took it as an intimation of their anger,
and he prepared for hostilities.</p>

<span class="large">THE MASSACRE.</span></h2>

<p>The year 1831 was known to early settlers in
Illinois as “The Dry Year.” There was little
rain and there were long spells of great heat, so
that vegetation was parched and the crop a
failure. The season of 1832 was just the opposite.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
During the first half of the month of
May there were numerous heavy thunder storms
with intervals of hot weather that made the
grass and flowers grow very rapidly, but delayed
the farmers in their planting. Also, the
several Indian scares interrupted the settlers in
their regular work in the fields.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">14</a>

<p>As already stated, immediately after the
breaking up of the Indian council after the defeat
of Stillman, Shabona rode in post haste to
the Davis Settlement and warned the people of
the danger of an Indian massacre. The whites
loaded on their wagons such articles as could
be readily handled, and drove to Ottawa, the
nearest fort, where there was a garrison of soldiers.</p>

<p>The Indians did not make the expected raid,
and slowly the settlers returned to their homesteads.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
During this retreat some of the people
tantalized Davis for running away from the
Indians, and his reply was that he would never
do so again.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, May 21st, Shabona
again rode to the Davis Settlement and warned
the whites that there was immediate danger of
a massacre. At this time it happened that Davis
was at Ottawa on some business when Shabona
called. However, his family and the neighbors
hastily loaded their furniture and other movable
articles on wagons, and hurriedly drove off
to Ottawa. They had almost reached the fort
when they met Davis, who ordered his own family
to return, and urged the return of his immediate
neighbors, inviting them all to go to his
place where they would be perfectly safe. The
Halls, Hendersons and Pettigrews, with two
farm hands named Henry George and Robert
Norris, reluctantly returned with Davis, and
arrived at his cottage about noon.</p>

<p>After dinner John W. Henderson, Alexander
Davis and a younger son of William Davis, Edward
and Greenbury Hall, and Allen Howard,
went to a field about one hundred rods south of
the Davis cottage, to plant corn. In the middle
of the afternoon William Hall, John W. Hall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Robert Norris, Henry George and William
Davis, Jr., who were working on the mill-dam,
gathered into the blacksmith shop where Davis
was repairing his gun, to get a drink from a
pail of water which had been brought from a
nearby spring. All the loaded guns and the
ammunition were in the dwelling house, where
Pettigrew, with his baby in his arms, was chatting
with the ladies who were sewing by the
open door. The afternoon was very hot and
was not inspiring to great exertion. The furniture
which had been loaded to drive to Ottawa,
was still on the wagons that stood in the yard.
The perfume of the blooming flowers filled the
air which was rich in its freshness after the
many days of rain and lightning. All nature
seemed to instill in the little Davis Settlement a
feeling of safety or at least to relieve them from
alarm during the daytime. With the coming
darkness, no doubt, they would have all gathered
into the little cottage and some of the men
would have stood guard with their guns to
watch for Indians.</p>

<p>About four o’clock a party of sixty to seventy
Indians suddenly leaped over the garden fence,
filled the yard, and part of them rushed towards
the house. Mr. Pettigrew leaped forward to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
close the door, but was instantly shot dead.
Through the open door the Indians rushed with
spears, and hatchets, and guns, filling the little
cottage. There was no place to hide and no
chance for the whites to escape. In her despair
Mrs. Pettigrew threw her arms around Rachel
Hall and was killed by a shot so close to Rachel
as to blacken her face with the powder. Rachel
jumped upon the bed, which only placed her in
view of more Indians and increased the danger
of being shot.</p>

<p>The piteous screams of the women and children
were terrifying. The Indians stuck them
with spears and hacked them with tomahawks
without feeling or mercy, and as they fell each
victim’s scalp was cut off with a big knife.</p>

<p>An Indian grabbed Pettigrew’s baby by the
legs, rushed out doors, swung the child over
his head, and dashed its brains out against a
stump in the yard. There, also, an Indian on
each side held the youngest Davis boy by his
hands, the little lad standing pale and silent,
and a third Indian shot him dead. As his limp
body fell, an Indian scalped him.</p>

<p>In a few moments all the whites in the house
excepting Sylvia and Rachel Hall, namely: Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Wm. Hall, aged forty-five years, her daughter
Elizabeth, aged eight years, Wm. Pettigrew,
his wife and two children, and Mrs. Wm. Davis
and her five children, were killed.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of the Indians bewildered
the men who were in the blacksmith shop,
as they were cut off from their guns and ammunition.
Young Davis slipped behind the shop
and thence escaped down the creek. The others
rushed towards the house and were met by a
volley of shots. William Hall, whose breast was
pierced by two bullets, with a prayer on his lips,
fell dead at his son John’s feet. Davis called
out to John Hall to “Take care!” and then
tried to escape to the woods. Notwithstanding
his prowess and that he made a desperate fight
for his life by using his unloaded gun as a club,
he was in a short time so overcome by Indian
warriors with their spears and tomahawks that
with innumerable wounds he sank dead in his
yard. John Hall was so paralyzed by the awful
carnage, that for a moment he did not move
from where his father lay. He watched the Indians
reloading their guns, then as a man awakening
from a night-mare he jumped down the
high bank and a volley of bullets passed over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
his head. By hugging closely to the bank next
the Indians, he scrambled hastily down the
stream and then ran as he never ran before,
thus escaping. Norris and George slid down
the bank and attempted to cross the creek, but
a volley of bullets from the Indians killed one
of them as he was climbing the bank, his body
falling back into the creek, and the other fell
on the green sward above.</p>

<p>John W. Henderson, two sons of Wm. Davis
and two sons of Wm. Hall, who were at work
in the cornfield when the Indians made the attack
upon the Davis cottage, comprehending the
situation, hastily fled to Ottawa. They had sped
only about two miles when John W. Hall overtook
them. By reason of his scudding from
death in the great heat and his excited condition,
John’s account of the massacre was incoherently
told with uncontrolled emotions of
grief and rage. Believing that the Indians
were pursuing, he did not check his speed, but
urged the others to extra efforts until they
reached the fort.</p>

<p>Sylvia and Rachel Hall were each seized by
two Indians who dragged them out of the cottage
to the yard where the final acts of the massacre
were taking place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>In their fiendish desire for revenge for Stillman’s
treachery and to terrify the whites, the
Indians cut out the hearts of some of the slain
and otherwise mutilated their bodies. Of all
the whites none but Rachel and Sylvia Hall remained
alive to witness the closing act of the
horrible tragedy. As they saw scattered in the
yard the bodies of their murdered parents, their
sister, and their neighbors&mdash;sixteen in all, the
girls were stupefied with horror. The wonder
is that the shock did not kill both of them.</p>

<p>The massacre has been described so often, and
is so sickening in its particulars, that we drop
the curtain on the tragic scene.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<span class="large">THE CAPTIVITY.</span></h2>

<p>A person never knows what he would do
under conditions and circumstances never before
experienced: a mother who would flee from
a cow, would, to protect her child, fight a tiger
without thought of her own safety; a timid
deer that would flee from a baby, when its
nature is changed by a serious wound will fight
a hunter to death; a soldier’s nature becomes so
changed in battle that he obeys orders like an
automaton and in his efforts to kill men exerts
himself until the sweat rolls down his face as it
would down the face of a harvest hand mowing
grass.</p>

<p>Sylvia and Rachel Hall, who in the peace of
their home would faint at the sight of blood,
had their nature so changed during the slaughter
and mutilation of their dear relatives and
friends that they viewed the scene with horror
that almost paralyzed them and put them in a
psychological condition of mental aberration.</p>

<p>The spell of lethargy was rudely broken when
the girls were dragged off as captives, first to
the creek, and, after Rachel had been pulled
half way across the stream, then back again to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the yard. There two Indians, each seizing one
of Sylvia’s hands, and two others taking Rachel
in a similar manner, hustled the girls northward
along the easterly side of the creek. The
girls were soon in unknown lands through
which they were tugged on, and on, not knowing
whither nor to what fate. Did they cry?
Of course they did; strong men would have
wept under similar circumstances. Did they
pray? Yes; but their prayers were not like the
Pharisee’s: they prayed with an intense feeling
from the bottom of their hearts and with all
the power of their souls. Were their prayers
answered? Were they? Read on, read on!</p>

<p>After being hustled and half dragged about
a mile and a half, they came to where a number
of horses were tied in the edge of a grove. Here
they met friends: horses belonging to their
father and their neighbors. The horses pricked
up their ears, looked at the girls and whinnied&mdash;returning
the girls’ recognition. If the girls
could have mounted two of these friendly animals
that were bred in Kentucky they might
have ridden to freedom; but it was not so to be.</p>

<p>The Indians put each girl on a pony furnished
with an Indian saddle and led by a warrior.
Thus they traveled on, keeping due north.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
After the sun had set the additional terror of
darkness was enveloping them. Occasionally a
night-hawk would break the awful silence by
swooping down from his great height with his
accustomed “Boo-oo-oo,” and a whippoor-will
would add his monotonous whistle from a decayed
log in the adjacent woods. Otherwise, it
was as solemn a procession as ever moved to the
grave, and only for the crack of his whip and
an occasional “ugh” from an Indian there was
little to attract attention until they passed a
large grove on their left. The girls had heard
of Shabona’s Grove. Was this that historical
sylvan place? Would Shabona come to their
relief? He had saved them and their friends
before, and if it had not been for the obstinacy
of Davis they would not have been in their
awful predicament. But the chief, worn out
and tired from his long wild ride of the night
before and asleep in his tent, was unconscious
of the passing of that strange and unusual procession.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed as the girls rode along
weary and heart-sick on that dark night, with
nothing but the stars to light their way, and not
a ray of hope in their hearts. The head waters
of Indian creek and of the Somonauk had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
passed and the source of the Sycamore was
reached just as the moon was rising, 51 minutes
after twelve o’clock.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Here the first stop
was made and the girls were allowed to rest on
some blankets on which they sat together, not
daring to lie down to sleep. The Indians
holding their ponies by the bridles, danced a
little, but nothing was said that would indicate
their intent, either as to the place of destination
or what they intended to do with their captives.
As the girls could not speak the Indian
language or understand it, there was little medium
of communication between them and the
Indians. Their feelings of sorrow for their murdered
relatives mixed with the uncertainty of
their own fate, and their disheveled hair and
soiled cheeks through which their tears washed
courses, made them objects of woeful misery.
Oh! if the girls could only wash their faces,
which were stained with powder and the blood
of their dear friends, or even in their sorrow
comb each other’s hair as they had often done
at their father’s cottage, it would have refreshed
them, and, to some extent, relieved their
distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>About half-past three o’clock in the morning
of May 22nd, the girls were replaced on the
ponies, the Indians remounted, and once more
the train proceeded in its former order, with
Indians before, on the sides, and in the rear of
the girls. They passed groves, here and there,
and hour after hour, with tiresome monotony,
they moved along.</p>

<p>After the sun had lapped the dew, it grew
very warm and Rachel became weary almost to
collapse. She thought that if she could walk
for a little while it would give her relief, notwithstanding
her weak condition from fasting
and worry. She did not know the language of
the Indians, but necessity finds a way: she made
signs of distress and indicated that she wanted
to walk. The Indians understood her and assisted
her from her pony. This little act of
gallantry gave her the first indication of their
human sympathy and inspired her with some
confidence in their honor.</p>

<p>Limp and staggering, she managed to keep
pace with the procession. When they reached
the Kishwaukee there was no hesitation and all
plunged into the stream. Rachel, who had not
been replaced on her pony, was forced to wade
across through water three feet deep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>It was now about two o’clock in the afternoon
and a stop was made about twenty-five miles
easterly from Stillman’s Run, on the west of
a large grove, to allow the ponies to graze on
the bank of the river. Here they remained for
about two hours. The Indians scalded some
beans and roasted some acorns, of which they
ate heartily and offered portions to the girls,
who tried to eat so as not to offend the Indians.</p>

<p>After the Indians had finished their lunch
they busied themselves in stretching on little
hoops the scalps that they had taken in the
massacre at Indian Creek. The girls immediately
recognized the scalps of some of their
friends, particularly the scalp of their mother.
The sight caused Sylvia to faint. Limp and unconscious
she lay beside her sister, who by the
incident was again put into her former psychic
condition, being oblivious to everything about
her excepting her sister’s care. The subconscious
thought that she had to protect Sylvia
inspired her with superhuman strength as well
as the fighting spirit of a lioness. If Sylvia
should die! what then? If she should be unable
to travel, would the Indians kill her? What torture
of mind Rachel must have suffered!</p>

<p>About four o’clock Sylvia regained her consciousness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
to the great relief of Rachel who recovered
her normal condition of mind. By this
time the Indians had gathered their horses, and
replacing the girls on the ponies that they had
been riding, all moved forward leisurely.</p>

<p>Shortly after starting a detachment of the
Indians was sent out to scout to the westward,
and after being gone some time they returned
apparently excited, and immediately the procession
assumed a double-quick, during which the
Indian guards in the rear held their spears
poised, as though they expected an attack.
After traveling in that manner for about five
miles, the Indians resumed their composure and
slackened their speed to a walking pace.</p>

<p>Had the Indians seen some of Gen. Whiteside’s
scouts? Had they learned that a detachment
of Illinois Militia, of which Abraham Lincoln
was a member, was moving towards them up
the Kishwaukee?<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Or, were the Indians pursued
by the friends of the girls?</p>

War.” 146.</p></div>

<p>If the whites should attack the Indians, Sylvia
and Rachel feared that they would share the
fate of their relatives and friends at the Davis
Settlement. Therefore, when the excitement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the Indians subsided, a feeling of relief from
danger of immediate death calmed the girls.</p>

<p>The extra exertion during the scare caused
the pony that Sylvia was riding to give out, and
it was abandoned. Sylvia was then placed behind
an Indian on a fine horse belonging to Mr.
Henderson, which, like the girls, had been taken
captive at Indian Creek. Thus they traveled,
on and on, until about nine o’clock in the evening
when they arrived at Black Hawk’s Grove
on the east side of the present city of Janesville,
Wisconsin, where the whole of Black Hawk’s
tribe was encamped.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> During twenty-eight
hours the girls had traveled about eighty miles
from the place of their capture, and were worn
out almost beyond description. No one can
fully comprehend their condition without reflecting
upon that extremely long ride on horseback,
without food or drink, mourning their
dead, and tortured with the worry over their
future fate.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Black Hawk’s Grove there
was great rejoicing at the Indian camp. Several
squaws hurried to the girls, assisted them
off their horses, and conducted them to the center
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
of the camp where they had prepared a
comfortable place in the form of beds of animal
skins and blankets. Also, the squaws brought
in wooden bowls, parched corn, meal and maple-sugar
mixed, which they invited the girls to
eat. More through fear than appetite, the girls
partook of the food, although it was disgusting
to them.</p>

<p>The squaws requested the girls to throw on
the fire particles of food and some tobacco
which they handed them. The girls complied
with the request of their dusky hosts, although
they did not know for what purpose it was required.
As a matter of fact, it was a common
practice among the Indian tribes to make the
offering of food and tobacco to their gods in
case of escape from death or as thanks for some
extraordinary good fortune.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The squaws requested Sylvia and Rachel to
lie down on separate beds, and then a squaw lay
on each side of each of the girls, so that there
was no chance for escape. Thus abed, they had
a night of confused, disordered sleep, in which
visions of their friends and the scenes of the
massacre haunted them almost continually. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
squaws endeavored to soothe the girls, but they
could not take the place of that mother who in
their childish nightmares would say to them:
“My dears, say a prayer and try to sleep.”</p>

<span class="large">TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>When John W. Hall arrived at Ottawa he did
not know that his sisters had been taken prisoners,
but he supposed that they had been massacred
with the rest of the people at the Davis
cottage. His first impulse was revenge, and he
rushed wildly about, urging men to arm and go
with him to the scene of the massacre. The
spirit of adventure was rampant among the
people at the time, and John soon found himself
at the head of a considerable number of
mounted men armed with all kinds of guns, who
followed him like a mob, from Ottawa to the
Davis Settlement.</p>

<p>On their way out they met some of the men
who were defeated at Stillman’s Run, returning
to Ottawa. John endeavored to have these men
accompany him to the Davis Settlement, but
they had enough of Indian adventure, and instead
of assisting John, discouraged the men
with him from engaging in a fight with the
Indians.</p>

<p>When John’s squadron arrived at the Davis
cottage there was presented an awful sight&mdash;thirteen
murdered and mutilated bodies in and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
about the cottage, some hung on shambles like
butchered pigs, just as they were left by the
Indians. On the creek below the cottage were
found the bodies of Norris and George where
they fell from the bullets of the Indians. The
absence of his sisters Rachel and Sylvia from
among the dead, presented to John a new quandary.
A careful search was made about the
premises but no traces of the girls could be
found.</p>

<p>After having seen the awful deaths of their
fellow-whites, the men who accompanied John
had their desire for adventure changed to a
feeling of fear, which they tried to hide under
the excuse that it would be impossible to proceed
after the Indians without rations and tents.</p>

<p>The situation was a trying one for John. In
vain did he appeal to the men to help him rescue
his sisters. Not one would volunteer to go with
him, and after burying all the dead in one grave
in front of the little cottage, John and his
squadron hastily returned to Ottawa.</p>

<p>In hopes of rescuing his sisters, John again
recruited a force and obtained the necessaries to
follow up the Indians. Early on the second day
after the massacre, with about forty men and
two days’ rations, without any commissary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
John led his little army to the Davis Settlement
and along the Indian trail until he lost it on
the great prairie. He concluded that the Indians
had taken the “Kishwaukee Trail” to
where the Kishwaukee flows into the Rock
River, and he followed that route until he arrived
at his objective point without attaining
his chief aim. Disappointed in not even getting
any information of his sisters and in not finding
further track of the Indians, and his rations
having run out, John was again obliged to return
with his troops to Ottawa for a fresh supply,
when once more he started on a fruitless
search for his sisters.</p>

<span class="large">MILITARY MOVEMENTS.</span></h2>

<p>When a remnant of Stillman’s men returned
to Dixon after an exciting ride of twenty-four
miles from Stillman’s Run, they reported that
they had been attacked by thousands of Indians
and that all the rest of the army had been massacred.
The exaggerated report set a few of the
men who had not been with Stillman, keen to
fight; but it instilled into most of them a sense
of home-sickness, and many of them requested
to be excused from duty. Gen. Taylor immediately
reported the situation to Gen. Atkinson,
at Ottawa, and the latter ordered Generals
Whiteside and Harney, who were in command
of some United States regulars, to pursue the
Indians.</p>

<p>When the troops arrived at Stillman’s Run
they found the bodies of thirteen soldiers and
most of the deserted commissary which had included
a barrel of whiskey that Black Hawk
emptied on the ground. Black Hawk destroyed
the wagons and everything else that could not
be carried away, excepting a few boats that belonged
to the Indians which were left on the
river bank.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact Black Hawk had only
forty warriors with him at the time of the attack
on him by Stillman’s men, while Stillman
had about three hundred men. At the time of
the attack many of Stillman’s men were under
the influence of liquor and most of them in such
a state of insubordination that they paid no
attention to the orders of their officers. Thus
they rushed into the camp of Black Hawk, and,
as each was acting independently, it was but a
short time until the Indians by their shots and
yells had the militia scared crazy and on the
run.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a>

<p>On May 22nd, in accordance with Gen. Anderson’s
order, Gen. Whiteside took up and followed
the Indian trail for thirty-six miles along
the Kishwaukee and the Sycamore; but when
the high prairie was reached, the Indians scattered
so in all directions that the troops were
unable to track them further, and the army
proceeded to the Fox River and down that
stream to Ottawa, where it arrived on May 27th.</p>

<p>On the day that the girls passed a few miles
to the east, the United States troops found on
the Sycamore, articles belonging to the Indians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
who committed the massacre at Davis Settlement,
among which were three scalps. Perhaps
it was fortunate for the girls that Gen. Whiteside
had not discovered and attacked the Indians,
because under such circumstances the
Indians might have murdered them.</p>

<p>Among the troops under Gen. Whiteside was
the company in which Captain Abraham Lincoln,
subsequently the great president of the
United States, served. Probably the girls had
not yet heard of him, who, if he had known of
their predicament, might have ended their captivity
on that day.</p>

<p>During the march up the Sycamore, an old
Pottawatomie Indian came into camp, tired and
hungry, with a letter of safe conduct, signed
by Gen. Lewis Cass. Some of the men declared
the letter was a forgery, and that the Indian
was a spy and should be put to death. When
the soldiers threatened the poor fellow, Capt.
Lincoln stepped forward and said that he would
shoot any man who would assault the Indian.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
It can be readily seen how a man of Lincoln’s
bravery and superior mental resources, might
have freed the girls without injury to them.</p>

<span class="large">REWARD OFFERED.</span></h2>

<p>The day after the massacre messengers carried
the news in all directions to the various
settlements in Illinois, southern Wisconsin,
northern Indiana and western Michigan. At
every settlement block-houses or stockades were
built and the whites prepared to defend themselves
against attacks of the Indians. At Galena
the people assembled on May 28th and
passed resolutions (among other things) deploring
the captivity of the Hall girls and declaring
their obligations to obtain the release of the
captives. In Michigan along the lake shore,
there was great excitement, intensified by frequent
rumors that the Indians were coming.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
Michigan newspapers, 1832.</p></div>

<p>Gen. Atkinson who was then at Ottawa offered
the Indians a reward of $2,000 in horses, goods
or money, for the safe delivery of the girls, as it
was feared that if force were used the Indians
would murder the girls. In Wisconsin, Col.
Dodge who had command at Blue Mounds Fort
(25 miles west of Madison, Wisconsin), immediately
recruited an army and made plans to get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the girls. Lieutenant Edward Beouchard at
Blue Mounds and Henry Gratiot of Gratiot’s
Grove (15 miles northeast of Galena), who were
friends of the Indians with whom they had
great influence, engaged in the search for the
girls.</p>

<p>Gratiot went to Turtle Village (now Beloit,
Wisconsin), where there was a tribe of Winnebagoes
with whom he had been on friendly
terms and who were supposed to be friends of
the whites. However, the Indians took him
prisoner and he almost sacrificed his life in his
endeavor to obtain the release of the Hall girls.
He succeeded, however, in making his message
known to the Indians, and arousing among them
a strong incentive to obtain the reward. While
he was held as a prisoner, an Indian chief to
whom Gratiot had often given presents and
shown kindness, came to him and offered his
services to aid in Gratiot’s escape. Also Col.
Gratiot was the government agent who paid the
Winnebagoes their annual allowance from the
United States government, which, no doubt, had
some influence. The Indian took the Colonel to
his tent, and late in the night silently conducted
him to the river and gave him a canoe in which
he paddled to safety. On his return home,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Gratiot reported that the captive girls were
somewhere near the head of Rock River in
southern Wisconsin. He had gleaned that much
information from conversations among the Indians
whose language he understood.</p>

<p>Not knowing that Col. Gratiot had visited
Turtle Village, Gen. Anderson sent by messenger
to Blue Mounds, the following letter:</p>

<p class="author">
“Headquarters Right Wing West. Dept.,<br />
Dixon’s Ferry, 27th May, 1832.</p>

<p>“Sir:</p>

<p>“In the attack of the Sac Indians on the settlements
on a branch of Fox River the 22nd
inst., fifteen men, women, and children, were
killed, and two young women were taken prisoners.
This heart-rending occurrence should
not only call forth our sympathies, but urge us
to relieve the survivors.</p>

<p>“You will therefore proceed to the Turtle
Village or send someone of confidence and prevail
on the head chiefs and braves of the Winnebagoes
there to go over to the hostile Sacs
and endeavor to ransom the prisoners. Offer
the Winnebagoes a large reward to effect the
object: $500 or $1000 for each.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>“I expected to have heard from you before
this.</p>

<p class="author">
Very respectfully your obt. sevt.,<br />
H. ATKINSON,<br />
Brig. Gen., U. S. Army.”</p>

<p>
“Henry Gratiot, Esq.,<br />
<span class="i4">Indian Agent.”</span></p>

<p>When the dispatch reached the Mounds on
May 28, Col. Gratiot who had already visited
Turtle Village had not returned, and Lieutenant
Beouchard who was then in command of the
Port, opened the dispatch and forwarded it to
the Colonel. Also, Beouchard sent the substance
of the dispatch to Col. Dodge, who was
then at Port Union, Col. Dodge’s residence,
near Dodgeville. Then Lieutenant Beouchard
mounted his horse and rode to a Winnebago
encampment which was situated northeast of
Blue Mounds where Chief Wau-kon-kah was the
head Indian. Beouchard requested the chief to
go to White Crow, Whirling Thunder and
Spotted Arm and inform them of the captivity
of the Hall girls, and the reward that had been
offered for their release, instructing the Indians
to get the girls at any risk: by purchase, if possible;
but by force, if necessary. He assured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the Indians that they would receive the reward
in case of success. The Indians promised to
make the attempt.</p>

<p>May 28th, Col. Gratiot wrote a letter to Governor
Porter, of Michigan, telling of the Indian
Creek Massacre and the captivity of the
Hall girls, and, among other things, said: “Compelled
by our feelings and relying on the justice
of our country, we did not hesitate to promise
a few of my trusty Winnebagoes a reward
if they would bring us those ladies unhurt. We
promised them the highest reward that could
be offered.” Therefore, it is evident that Gratiot
had offered a reward for the release of the
girls before he received Gen. Anderson’s dispatch.</p>

<p>On the day that Col. Gratiot returned from
Turtle Village, he received Gen. Anderson’s
letter. On the same day he received further
information that the Winnebagoes had success
in their endeavors to ransom the unfortunate
girls, and he immediately started for Blue
Mounds, where he arrived on June 2nd.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="large">THE CAPTIVE GIRLS.</span></h2>

<p>In Chapter V we left the girls as prisoners at
Black Hawk’s Grove, Janesville, Wisconsin.
Notwithstanding their night of disturbed sleep
and great need for rest, the girls were awakened
at daylight by the noise of the Indians
around the tent.</p>

<p>Soon after the girls arose the squaws brought
them their breakfast which consisted of dried
sliced meat, coffee and porridge made of corn
pounded and water, that was served in wooden
bowls with wooden spoons. The little rest that
the girls got through the night, revived them
and gave them some appetite, so that they were
able to eat part of the food, although they did
not relish it.</p>

<p>Breakfast being finished, the Indians cleared
off a piece of ground about ninety feet in circumference
and erected in the center a pole
about twenty-five feet high, around which they
set up fifteen spears, on the points of which
were placed the scalps of the murdered friends
of the girls. To the horror of the girls, they
recognized the scalps of their father, mother
and Mrs. Pettigrew. Upon three separate spears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the Indians placed three human hearts, which
added greatly to the horror of the girls. Was
one of the hearts their mother’s?</p>

<p>The Indians jabbered among themselves for
awhile and then the squaws painted one side of
the face of each of the girls red and the other
side black. Then the girls were laid with their
faces downward on blankets near the center,
just leaving room for the Indians to pass between
them and the pole. When these preliminaries
were completed, the warriors, grasping
in their hands their spears, which they occasionally
struck into the ground, and yelling all the
while as Indians only can, danced around the
girls. Every moment while this was going on,
the girls expected to be thrust through with
the spears; but they had become so harrassed
with dread of torture, that they almost wished
to have death end their troubles. However, not
one of the spears touched the girls, and outside
of keeping them in terror, they were in
nowise injured.</p>

<p>After the warriors had continued their dance
for about half an hour, two old squaws (one of
whom was the wife of Black Hawk) led the
girls away to a wigwam where they washed off
the paint as well as they could by scrubbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
them unmercifully. The squaws had adopted
the girls, and, as the children of chiefs, they
were not required to work.</p>

<p>The Indians having finished their dance,
struck their tents, and, after a good deal of
bustle and confusion, the whole camp started
in a northerly direction. When they reached
a point beyond the grove, it seemed to the girls
that the whole earth was alive with Indians.
Probably not less than 4,000 warriors, squaws,
and children constituted that army.</p>

<p>Tired and sore from their former long ride
and greatly exhausted by their constant fears,
it was an extraordinary ordeal for the girls to
plunge still farther into the wilderness. During
traveling hours the girls were separated and
each was placed in charge of two squaws.
Whenever the army halted the girls were
brought together, but always kept under the
surveillance of the four squaws.</p>

<p>Their march from Black Hawk’s Grove was
very slow and over a broad prairie. Shortly
before sundown the Indians pitched their tents
at Cold Spring, about three miles southeast of
Ft. Atkinson, near “Burnt Village,” the camp
of Little Priest.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>As soon as the tents were erected everybody
partook of some food, most of the Indians without
any utensils, but the girls were supplied
with the usual dishes: wooden plates, bowls and
spoons. At this place maple-sugar seemed to be
abundant and the girls were furnished all of it
that they could eat. Also, the squaws seemed
to appreciate the fact that the girls were suffering
from exposure, and took great pains to
make their quarters as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>During their long tramp through the brush,
the light working dresses that the girls had on
at the time that they were captured had become
badly torn, and the squaws brought Rachel a
red and white calico dress with ruffles around
the bottom, and Sylvia, a blue calico. The Indians
requested the girls to throw away their
shoes and put on moccasins, against which the
latter strongly protested and refused to take off
their shoes. No violence to take away their
shoes was used, and the girls continued to wear
them. An Indian threw away Rachel’s comb
and she immediately went after it and kept it
so that it could not be snatched away again
without using force, to which the Indians did
not resort.</p>

<p>As night set in the Indians retired and each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the girls had to sleep between two squaws,
which they were compelled to do thereafter up
to the time that they were turned over to the
Winnebagoes.</p>

<p>Day after day the Indians changed the location
of their camp, probably to evade the whites
if they should pursue them. From Cold Spring
by circuitous routes, through the beautiful lake
country around Oconomowoc, they moved
northward until they reached the rolling hills
near Horicon Lake where they pitched their
camp not far from the rapids, and southeast of
the Indian village of Big Fox.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The girls had now traveled about 150 miles
north from their home. It was the eighth day
of their captivity, and to them the time was so
long that every minute seemed almost a day;
and since they last sat at dinner in the little
cottage of William Davis at Indian Creek, although
very vivid in their minds, seemed an
age. Also, the unknown places at which they
had camped being in such various directions
from each other, the girls had no idea how far
they had gone from Black Hawk’s Grove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
(Janesville). Everywhere they traveled Indian
camps were numerous, because as soon as spring
had opened the Indians divided into small
camps to make maple sugar. Were the girls to
put an estimate upon the number of Indians in
that unknown region, it certainly would have
reached high up into the thousands.</p>

<p>At every camp the dance around the pole
with all its hideous surroundings, accompanied
by the Indian yells and war-whoops, the rattling
of gourds, and waving of weapons, was repeated.</p>

<p>Among the tribes east of the Mississippi River
it was an honor principle that their female captives
should not be tortured nor their chastity
violated; but if white men were taken captives
they were reduced to slavery and obliged to
wait upon the white women after they had been
adopted by the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Notwithstanding this
unwritten law, these dances with the scalps on
the spears harrassed the girls and caused them
to sob and weep bitterly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">25</a>

<p>One morning after many repetitions of the
dance around the pole, the program was varied
by a party of warriors coming to the lodge
where the girls were in the custody of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
squaws, placing in their hands small red flags,
and then the Indians with their captives
marched around the encampment, stopping at
each wigwam and waving their flags at the
doors, accompanied by some recitation of a
chief and the rattling of gourds, all of which
was not understood by the girls and they were
unable to comprehend the significance of what
they were doing. As a matter of fact the performance
was a religious ceremony in which
the gourds took the place of bells used by several
Christian denominations during their religious
ceremonies.</p>

<span class="large">RANSOMED.</span></h2>

<p>On the morning of the ninth day of their captivity,
some warriors took Sylvia off about forty
rods to where a number of chiefs seemed to be
holding a council. One of the Indians told
Sylvia that she must go with an old chief who
was pointed out to her, namely, White Crow,
a chief of the Winnebagoes, who was about
fifty years of age, tall, slim, with a hawk nose,
and as much of sinister look as a man who had
only one eye could have, for one of his eyes
had been put out in a brawl. He was addicted
to drink, gambling, fighting, and other disreputable
practices.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Under any circumstances
Sylvia might have protested against going with
him; but when he informed her that Rachel
must stay behind, Sylvia declared that she
would not go without her sister. White Crow,
who was a fine and fluent orator, and spokesman
of his band on all occasions, made a long, loud
speech in which he exhibited considerable excitement,
but was listened to with great interest
by the other warriors. After he had finished,
Chief Whirling Thunder arose, walked over to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
where Rachel was and brought her to where the
council was being held. The situation was painfully
interesting to the girls, because they had
some intimation that it was all about their fate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">26</a>

<p>After some conversation among the chiefs
they shook hands and the captives were surrendered
to White Crow, who must now get the
girls to Blue Mounds Fort to obtain the $2,000
reward. The Port was about eighty miles to
the southwest in a bee line. By the nearest trail
through the Madison lake region, it was about
ninety-three miles; and by way of Portage and
thence on the Military Road to the Blue Mounds
Fort, it was about one hundred and seven miles.
The Sacs and Foxes were along the former
route, which meant great danger, and the Military
Road was the best in that country. Therefore,
White Crow chose the latter route. The
horses were brought, riding switches were cut
and White Crow and Whirling Thunder with
their captives seemed ready to go. The squaws
with whom the girls had been staying were very
much grieved at parting with them, tears rolling
down their cheeks, and the girls who now
reciprocated the affection of the squaws, preferred
to stay with them rather than to go with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the warriors; but the chief’s stern orders had to
be obeyed.</p>

<p>At this trying moment of the girls, a young
warrior suddenly stepped up to Rachel and with
a large knife cut a lock of hair from over her
right ear and another from the back of her
head. At the same time he muttered to White
Crow, in the Indian language, something which
the girls afterwards learned, was that he would
have Rachel back in three or four days. His
example was followed by another Indian who
stepped up to Sylvia and without leave or a
word of explanation, cut a lock of hair from
the front of her head and placed it in his hunting-pouch.
Sometime afterward a number of
Indians made an attack on Kellogg’s Grove
colony (near Dodgeville, Wis.) and one of them
who was shot by a miner named Casey had
around his neck a lock of braided hair which
was subsequently identified as that taken from
the head of Rachel Hall.</p>

<p>It might not be amiss, here, to state that
among some of the Indian tribes the cutting of
the hair had a mystical meaning closely allied
to the life of a person, and was usually attended
with religious rites. The first clipping of a
child’s hair was retained for religious purposes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
A scalp had a double meaning: it indicated an
act of supernatural power that had decreed the
death of the man, and it served as tangible
proof of the warrior’s prowess over his
enemies.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p class="caption">WHERE HALL GIRLS ENTERED CANOES.</p>
</div>

<p>While the Indians were taking locks of hair
from the girls, White Crow, Whirling Thunder,
and a few more Indians, had mounted their
horses, and with their captives on ponies, all
rode off at a gallop, keeping up a rapid speed
during the rest of the day and far into the
night, the Indians looking back frequently.</p>

<p>No doubt White Crow feared that the Sacs
might regret that they let the girls go, and
would try to recapture them. It was about
forty-seven miles to Portage, and until that
place was reached the danger was great. The
girls appreciated the danger; otherwise, they
would have dropped off their ponies from sheer
exhaustion. A ride of forty-seven miles on
wabbly ponies!</p>

<p>Finally, they arrived on the bank of the Wisconsin
River near the mouth of Duck Creek
(just below Portage, Wis.) where was located
a village of Chief Dekorah.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">28</a>

Kinzie, 103.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>At this place the Indians prepared a bed
upon a low scaffold, which was furnished with
abundant blankets and furs, where the girls lay
until daylight. The sun had not yet arisen
when a party of Sac warriors, some of whom
were dressed in the clothing of white men, came
into camp. They wanted to talk to the girls,
but Whirling Thunder told the girls not to
listen to them and to keep away from them.
Then a long conversation of loud angry words
was kept up between the Indians for some time,
when the Sacs mounted their horses and rode
away.</p>

<p>It was ascertained later that one of the Indians
who helped to capture the girls at Indian
Creek was on a hunting trip when the captives
were turned over to the Winnebagoes and on his
return finding the prisoners gone and not having
received his portion of the ransom, he
started off with a number of warriors with the
determination to recapture the girls or kill
them. No doubt that if the Sacs had overtaken
the Winnebagoes with their captives before they
had reached the Winnebago camp, they would
have fought for the girls, which would either
have ended in the death of the girls or their
being again carried off into captivity. Such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
was the Indian custom.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> What an almost
miraculous escape the girls had!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">29</a>
2, Handbook of American Indians, 203.</p></div>

<p>Immediately after the Sacs left, a hastened
breakfast was prepared. No doubt White Crow
feared an attack if he should keep the girls at
that place or if he should continue his journey
along the Military Road. Whatever caused him
to change his course, he arranged to take the
girls down the Wisconsin River<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and to send
the horses around over the hills, on the west
side of the river, to the next camping place.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a>
Memories of Shaubena, 160.</p></div>

<p>Breakfast was eaten as hastily as it had been
prepared and then the girls were placed in
canoes and with a convoy of about one hundred
Indians, were paddled off. At first the girls
feared that their little barks would tip, but
soon they found their canoes were in expert
and safe hands and that the new manner of
travel was far superior to horse-back riding.
It was restful and gave them a fine opportunity
for observation, which under favorable circumstances
would drive an artist into ecstasy. The
majestic bluffs with wooded slopes and craggy
crests, lined the river for many miles, stretching
off to the west around Devil’s Lake. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
ideal scenery and connected with many a
romantic Indian tale.</p>

<p>The spring freshets from the melting snows
and heavy rains, had swollen the river so that
it spread considerably over its banks, reaching
in places from the foot of one bluff to the foot
of another. Down this murky water the Indians
paddled their canoes, hour after hour,
over a distance of about thirty miles, and
landed on the west bank, where they camped
for the night.</p>

<p>In speaking of this canoe ride the girls say:
“The name of the river we never knew, neither
can we tell whether we traveled up or down
the stream.” The name of the river was learned
from Shabona. It is not strange that the girls
could not tell which way the river flowed. The
writer has often been on that river during
freshets, and the way the water flows back and
forth, dotted with eddies, would easily confuse
a stranger.</p>

<p>Early the next morning White Crow went
around to the wigwams with a gourd in each
hand, and stopping at the door of each wigwam
he would shake the gourds violently and talk as
if he were lecturing.</p>

<p>Having finished this religious service, he left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the camp and did not return again until sundown.
Probably, he crossed the river and went
to his own village at the west end of Mendota
Lake to get information concerning the ransom
offered for the captives. He was a sly chief,
and if he did not have considerable confidence
in the success of his undertaking, instead of
taking the girls across to Blue Mounds he might
have them run further down the river and there
hold them longer in captivity.</p>

<p>The thirty-first day of May had arrived and
for the second night the Indians camped on the
west side of the Wisconsin River. Before retiring,
White Crow for the first time spoke to the
girls in the English language. He inquired
whether their father, mother, or any sister or
brother, was alive, to which the girls replied
that all had been killed on the day of their captivity.
White Crow appeared sad, shook his
head, and after hesitating a moment, said he
would take the girls home in the morning. He
asked the girls if they thought the whites would
hang him if he took them to the fort, to which
they replied that on the contrary the people at
the fort would give him money and presents for
his trouble.</p>

<p>The conversation with White Crow roused the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
hopes of the girls considerably, but a lingering
doubt as to the truth of his words kept revolving
in their minds throughout the night.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">WHERE HALL GIRLS LEFT WISCONSIN RIVER.<br />
† “BLACK HAWK’S LOOKOUT.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next morning the chiefs accompanied
by about forty warriors put the girls in canoes
and swam their horses across the river alongside
of the canoes, landing above the mouth of Black
Earth Creek. The horses were mounted in
haste, but as most of the warriors had to travel
on foot and were impeded by marshes and
underbrush on the flat bottom, the progress was
slow. The girls watched the sun with eagerness
in their endeavor to tell which way they were
traveling and were assured thereby that they
were again going southward, although only in
a circuitous course. Hour after hour passed
away, the girls all the while expecting to catch
sight of the fort. Finally, as the sun was sinking
off over the Wisconsin River, the Indians
once more camped for the night on the bank of
a creek.</p>

<p>There were two or three Indian families
camped at this place, and on seeing the girls
they expressed great joy. In a short time the
squaws had prepared a supper consisting of
pickled pork, potatoes, coffee and bread for the
girls, White Crow and Whirling Thunder, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
rest of the Indians dining apart from them.
The meal was the best cooked and the spread
the cleanest that had been placed before the
girls, and it tempted their appetite so that they
made a very fair meal, after which they felt
sleepy and were glad when they could lie down
to rest. In a short time most of the Indians had
retired, excepting White Crow, who seated himself
close to the girls, where he smoked a pipe
all night. This was the first time that a warrior
had kept guard over them, and the inference
of the girls was that the old chief feared
an attack of the Sacs who had visited their
camp at Portage. The girls thought that perhaps
the Indian chief who had been rebuffed at
that place might have gone after recruits, and
that at any moment the Indians might swoop
down upon them. Now, when they were almost
within grasp of their freedom, it racked the
minds of the girls to think that there was a
possibility of being slaughtered or again carried
into captivity. In this condition of mind the
girls passed the night.</p>

<p>The camp was astir at sunrise and for the
last time White Crow went around performing
his religious service by rattling his gourds and
addressing the Indians. After breakfast the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
girls were again mounted on their ponies and
all moved forward over higher ground, and before
ten o’clock they had reached the Military
Road from Fort Winnebago, by way of Blue
Mounds, to Prairie du Chien. The sight of the
wagon tracks was the first sign of civilization
that the girls had observed since their captivity
and increased their confidence in the probability
of their early release. Also, the road was much
better than any they had traveled since their
capture. It led through groves and oak openings,
along the high ridge that is unbroken to
the Mississippi River. Inspirations of hope were
necessary to revive the girls’ spirits and enable
them to complete the remainder of their long
journey, as they were exhausted to the verge of
collapse. Hope is a great stimulant, and it was
on this that the girls were now subsisting.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Auspicious Hope! in thy sweet garden grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreaths for each toil, a charm for every woe.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>About two o’clock in the afternoon the Indians
halted for lunch and to let their horses
feed. The principal food was duck eggs, nearly
hatched, that the Indians ate with relish, but
which the girls rejected with disgust. After
lunch they had not traveled far until they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
caught sight of Blue Mounds Fort in the distance.
White Crow took a white handkerchief
that Rachel had tied on her head, which he
fastened on a pole for a flag of truce, and rode
in advance of the Indians and their captives. In
a short time Lieutenant Edward Beouchard,
who was commander at the fort, met them and
addressed the Indians in their own language.
The warriors now formed a circle into which
Beouchard rode and he and the Indians talked
at considerable length. According to Beouchard’s
subsequent statement the Indians were
unwilling to give up the girls until they were
assured by Col. Gratiot that the $2,000 reward
would be paid. Beouchard having assured the
girls that they would be well treated by the
Indians until his return, went back to the fort
and soon returned with Col. Henry Gratiot, the
Indian agent, and a company of soldiers in
which Edward and Reason Hall, uncles of the
captives, were serving as privates.</p>

<p>Col. Gratiot assured the Indians that the reward
for the rescue of the girls would be paid.
Also, he invited the Indians to be his guests at
the fort, and that he would prepare a big feast
for them. The Indians being very hungry the
feast appealed very strongly to them. Finally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the chiefs agreed to place the girls in the custody
of Col. Gratiot until the reward would be
paid, the Indians retaining the right to the return
of the captives if the government failed to
pay.</p>

<p>The calico dresses which the girls had received
from the Indians, had become torn by
riding through brake, briars and brush, and
with their soiled faces and disheveled hair, made
them objects of pity.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In a sense, the girls
bearing their crosses, had followed their Master
up Calvary to its summit, where He granted
their prayer by setting them free.</p>

<p>Following close behind the soldiers that went
out with Col. Gratiot to meet the Indians with
the girls, were the ladies of the Fort, including
the wives of the commanding officers, and although
the Indians had delivered the girls into
the custody of Col. Gratiot, the ladies immediately
took charge of them, and after kissing
and hugging them affectionately, conducted
them to the Fort, where the girls were furnished
with new clothes and the best meal that
the place could produce. After dining the girls
became sleepy and retired to rest, feeling perfectly
secure.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>A messenger who had been dispatched for
Col. Dodge, met him on his way to the Mounds
in company with Capt. Bion Gratiot, a brother
of Col. Henry Gratiot. On his arrival Col.
Dodge immediately assumed general command
of the place. He invited the Indian chiefs,
White Crow, Whirling Thunder and Spotted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Arm, into the Fort, and fed them sumptuously.
Ebenezer Brigham who lived at the east end of
the Mounds contributed a big fat steer for the
feast. After the feast, lodgings for the Indians
were prepared, beds for the chiefs having been
provided in one of the cottages. Having everything
comfortably arranged, the Colonel retired
and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>About an hour after Col. Dodge had gone to
bed, Capt. Gratiot came rushing to his cabin in
an excited manner, calling to him to rouse up
and prepare for action immediately. He informed
the Colonel that the Indian chiefs whom
the Colonel had placed in the cottage, had gone
out to some brush near by and apparently were
inciting the Indians to make an attack upon the
Fort. White Crow had come to the Captain and
after telling him that the whites were a soft-shelled
breed and no good to fight (referring to
Stillman’s defeat), he closed by advising the
Captain to tell his brother, Col. Gratiot, the Indians’
friend, to go home and not stay at the
fort. Also, Capt. Gratiot had observed the men
whetting their knives, tomahawks and spears,
and it was learned that two of the warriors had
been sent to the Winnebago camp early in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
evening, probably to obtain more Indians to
attack the Fort.</p>

<p>Col. Dodge, after listening attentively to the
story of Capt. Gratiot, replied: “Do not be
alarmed, sir; I will see that no harm befalls
you.”</p>

<p>Col. Dodge then called the officer of the
guard and an interpreter and with six other
men went out to where the Indians were and
took into custody White Crow and five of the
other principal chiefs, and marched them into
a cabin inside the palisade to secure obedience
to his command. Then after directing the
proper officer to place a strong guard around
the cabin and double the guard around the
whole encampment, the Colonel lay down with
the Indians. To carry out the Colonel’s orders
took all the men at the Fort, so that virtually
the whole force was under arms during the
night.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Once more the girls’ lives were in
jeopardy.</p>

<p>The night passed without another incident
and when the sun arose over the great plains to
the east, the girls were up and relished a good
breakfast with their friends that awaited them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Col. Dodge was out before the girls and he told
the Indians that they must all go to Morrison’s
Grove, a place where the road to Galena
branches off the Military Road to Prairie du
Chien, about fifteen miles west of Blue Mounds.
The Indians&mdash;White Crow particularly&mdash;protested
against going, stating that their feet
were sore from their long march in bringing the
Hall girls to the Mounds, and that they had
shown such great magnanimity in risking their
lives to ransom the prisoners that they should
receive their reward and be allowed to return
home. Col. Dodge frankly told them that he
believed that they were in sympathy with Black
Hawk and that he should be obliged to treat
them as suspects. In vain did White Crow use
his eloquence in protesting his friendship for
the whites, and after all was in readiness the
Indians and soldiers accompanied by the Hall
girls started on their march to Morrison’s
Grove, where they arrived before noon. Here
George Medary kept a hotel in a large house
built by the Morrison brothers of hewn logs, adjoining
a cultivated field, one of the first in the
state.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The ladies looked after the comfort of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
girls, whom they welcomed with much exhibition
of joy and affection, and Col. Dodge, after
having the Indians well fed, ordered the chiefs
to line them up until he could talk to them.</p>

<p>First Col. Dodge explained the alarming situation
surrounding the white settlers, and the
information that he had that the Winnebagoes
were hesitating to join Black Hawk, and warned
them of their destruction if they should take
part in the war against the whites. Next Col.
Gratiot spoke to the Indians in their own
tongue, in a kindly manner, and after he had
finished White Crow made the following speech:
“Fathers, when you sent a request to me to go
and to ransom those two white women, we
called on all of our people who were around us
and they gave all of their wampum, trinkets
and corn, and we the chiefs gave ten horses.
The Little Priest, I, and two others, went to the
Sauks to buy the prisoners. We soon succeeded
in buying one, but for a time could not succeed
in buying the other. After we had bought one,
we demanded the other. They said, ‘No, we
will not give her up. We have lost too much
blood. We will keep her.’</p>

<p>“We told them: ‘If you don’t give her up,
we will raise the tomahawk and take her.’ I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
had a horse which you, father (Gratiot), gave
me. It was the last horse that I had. I told
them that I would give them that horse to obtain
the prisoner. At sundown they gave me
the girls and I gave them the horse. The Little
Priest took one of the girls and I took the other
and put them on horses. A Sauk came, as we
were about to start, and attempted to cut off the
hair of one of the girls. I caught his hand and
prevented him, but allowed him afterwards to
cut a small lock. These white sisters were very
much affected and my young daughter cried to
see these white sisters so distressed. Our women
bought clothes from the Sauks and gave them.
These sisters will tell you that we made them
sleep together, and the daughter of the Little
Priest slept on one side of them and my daughter
on the other side. We were mortified that
we could not use them better. Our blankets
are worn out and we could do no better. I
tried to please and comfort them, but they were
not accustomed to our mode of living and could
not eat.</p>

<p>“Here are our two sisters, we bring them here
to take their hands and give them into your
hands. We have saved their lives, for the
Sauks intended to kill them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>“And now, fathers, all that we have to ask
of you is that you will not put us or our children
in the same situation that these white
sisters were. We have brought them to you to
prove to you that we are the friends of the
Americans.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a>
Report of Col. Gratiot in U. S. files.</p></div>

<p>After listening to White Crow, Col. Dodge
informed him that he would hold as hostages
for the good conduct of the Winnebago Indians,
their chiefs Spotted Arm, Whirling Thunder
and Little Priest, to which the wiley chief made
little objection, as he was trying to obtain as
much goods as possible in final settlement of the
reward, which was paid mostly in trinkets,
blankets and horses.</p>

<p>Having been well fed and supplied with
shawls and blankets of brilliant colors, childlike,
the Indians were now anxious to go home.</p>

<p>White Crow, with a showing of much regret,
bade good-bye to Sylvia and Rachel Hall. He
went over the incidents of their rescue, and, to
prove his friendship for the girls, offered to
give each of them a Sac squaw as a servant for
life. The girls thanked him, but said that they
did not want any human being to be taken away
from her people as they had been from theirs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
The girls then bade adieu to all the Indians,
towards whom their hearts had changed, and
for whom they now felt considerable friendship.
The eloquence of White Crow made an impression
on the young women, as he spoke in a sympathetic
tone unexpected kind words that
touched their hearts.</p>

<p>After resting at Morrison’s during the afternoon
and night, early the next morning the soldiers
with their Indian hostages and the girls,
proceeded along the Galena road to Fort Defiance,
which was located five miles southeast
of Mineral Point. Here again the girls were
well cared for by the wives of the officers, and
the most sumptuous meal that could be prepared
was set before them, and their short stay
made as pleasant as possible.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>After dinner, with the convoy of soldiers and
the Indian hostages, the girls again moved on
to Gratiot’s Grove, about a mile south of Shullsburg,
and fourteen miles northeast of Galena.
At this place there was a village of twenty families,
with a hotel and a garrison of United
States soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The leading lady of the place
was Capt. Gratiot’s wife, a French woman of
excellent education, whose mother had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
lady-in-waiting to Queen Marie Antoinette.
Mrs. Gratiot, who was noted for her hospitality,
took charge of the girls and entertained them
lavishly at her home.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Gratiot’s Grove, which became renowned as
the most beautiful spot in the northwest, is
described by Mrs. Gratiot as follows: “Never
in my wanderings had I beheld a prettier place;
the beautiful rolling hills extending to Blue
Mounds, a distance of thirty miles, the magnificent
grove, as yet untouched by the falling axe,
formed the graceful frame for the lovely landscape.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
Theodore Rudolph, a Swiss traveler
who was at Gratiot’s Grove in the spring of
1832, describing the place says: “The vast
prairie, as far as the eye could reach, was
clothed with a carpet of richest green, interspersed
with gorgeous wild flowers, of brilliant
hues of red, blue, and yellow, in fact every color
of the rainbow&mdash;reminding one of the garden
of Eden, as our youthful fancies never failed to
paint it for us.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The thought of returning to their home filled
the girls’ hearts with such joy as was possible
under their circumstances. When they arose on
the morning of their departure from Gratiot’s
Grove, everything was inspiring. Never before
had the birds sung more sweetly nor had the
flowers looked more beautiful. The whole village
was astir early, and probably there was
not one of the inhabitants who failed to appear
to bid the girls good-bye.</p>

<p>Capt. Gratiot’s wife made the girls some nice
presents and had so endeared herself to them
that although they had known her but a very
short time, they left her with tears, and in tears.</p>

<p>Finally, all being ready, with a convoy of soldiers
the girls continued their journey to White
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Oak Springs (10 miles northeast of Galena),
near which they formerly lived and where they
had many friends. It was then a mining village
of considerable size, but not so charming as
Gratiot’s Grove. There was a fort with soldiers
at the place, and all was in readiness to
receive the girls. As some of their relatives
lived near the place, going there seemed to them
like going home.</p>

<p>One of the first surprises that the girls had,
was to meet their brother John who they
thought had been murdered at Indian Creek.
He had been mustered into the militia and was
stationed at Galena, but was granted indefinite
absence to go to meet his sisters and accompany
them home.</p>

<p>At White Oak Springs they received a letter
from their former pastor, Rev. R. Horn, who
had a mission on the Illinois River where Robert
Scott, an uncle of the girls, lived. The letter
was full of kindness and invited the girls to
come to the Horn residence and make it their
home. From that time on, all arrangements
were made to that end.</p>

<p>On the night of June sixteenth, great excitement
was caused by a messenger riding into
the town and announcing that the battle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Peckatonica (18 miles northeast) had been
fought, that all the Indians that participated
in it had been killed, and that many of the
whites had fallen. The shocking particulars,
which were loathing to the girls, were told and
retold. They had seen human blood spilled and
they knew what such a sight meant, so it simply
renewed their horror.</p>

<p>The girls remained at White Oak Springs two
weeks, during which their lady friends made
considerable clothing for them so that they had
a well-supplied wardrobe, considering the time
and the border country. The men were not
backward in the good work and presents of
goods were given by the store-keepers and a
small purse raised to help to smooth their way.</p>

<p>Also, old acquaintances were renewed and
new friendships were formed from which it
was hard to break away when it came time to
leave. From gruff old miners up to the army
officer in his shoulder-straps, the village folk
gathered around the young ladies to wish them
God-speed.</p>

<p>The girls shook hands with everybody and
thanked them, individually and collectively, for
their great kindness. In the last written statement
signed by Rachel Hall Munson and Sylvia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Hall Horn, they say: “We are very sorry we
cannot recollect the names of those kind friends,
that they might appear upon record as a testimony
of their kindness to us in our destitute
condition. May the blessings of our Father in
heaven, rest upon them all!”</p>

<p>From White Oak Springs the girls went on
to Galena, where they stopped with an old acquaintance
named Bell and were supplied with
rations by the United States’ army officers who
considered the girls their guests.</p>

<p>They had not been there many days before
the steamboat “Winnebago” called for a load
of lead to take to St. Louis. The girls with
their brother John and their uncle Edward
Hall took passage down the Mississippi to St.
Louis where they arrived June 30, and were received
by Gov. Clark who took them to his
home and entertained them as his guests.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, at that time the cholera was
in the city and meetings of people, public demonstrations,
and entertainments, were restricted.
While the girls did not feel like attending
entertainments or going in society, the people
of St. Louis were anxious to entertain them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>A purse of $470.00 was collected, and, at the
request of the girls, was put into the hands of
Mr. Horn for investment. Other small sums of
money were given to the girls to pay their incidental
expenses, and articles for their comfort
were presented to them.</p>

<p>The girls were anxious to go home, and in
company with their brother John and Uncle
Edward they boarded the steamer “Carolina”
for Beardstown, Ill., from where they were
taken to the home of their uncle Robert Scott,
close to Mr. Horn’s. Here they remained until
Fall, when they went to the home of their
brother John who had recently married and
settled on a homestead in Bureau County, about
twenty miles west of the Davis Settlement.</p>

<span class="large">ROMANCE AND HISTORY.</span></h2>

<p>At a little country store down in Indiana
where the settlers usually gathered to read the
weekly newspaper, William Munson, a young
man who was born in New York, first heard of
the Hall girls and their wonderful adventure.
He was in the west seeking his fortune, and,
being an admirer of the brave and full of youthful
fire, he remarked to the people that he
would some day marry one of those girls. His
nearest friends did not take him seriously, and
the matter as a passing joke was soon forgotten.
However, with him it became a fixed idea,
and in the spring of 1833 he went to Illinois and
took up a land claim in the neighborhood where
John W. Hall lived.</p>

<p>Every good woman is not satisfied until she
has a home of her own. This natural longing
was particularly strong in the minds of the
Hall girls, whose home had been destroyed.</p>

<p class="caption">WILLIAM MUNSON.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no record of how William Munson
first met Rachel Hall, but our information shows
that their courtship was short; for in March,
1833, they were united in marriage, and shortly
afterwards they settled down on the land claim
entered by her father, about a mile and a half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
east of the scene of the massacre. They were
thrifty and got along splendidly, becoming one
of the foremost families of La Salle County.
Besides the rich abundance of worldly goods,
they were blessed with a large family of whom
four died in their infancy. As there was no
cemetery, the little ones were buried in the
garden. Of the other children who grew up to
manhood and womanhood, several became very
prominent and their generations became numerous.
Their four daughters were married as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
follows: Irena, to Dr. George Vance, who moved
to California; A. Miranda, to Samuel Dunavan,
who settled on a farm just north of the Munson
homestead, where she still lives; Fidelia, to
George Shaver, and Phoebe M., to John F. Reed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of Ottawa. Mr. Reed’s daughter Fannie was
married to James H. Eckles who was Comptroller
of the Currency under Cleveland; and
Mr. Reed’s daughter Winnie is married to Judge
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, of Chicago. Mrs.
Munson left three sons: William, Louis and
Elliot, and through them several grand-children.</p>

<p class="caption">MRS. RACHEL HALL MUNSON, AGED 42, AND YOUNGEST

<p>Edward Vance, a grand-son of Mrs. Munson,
is a well-known lawyer in South Dakota, and
Douglas Dunavan is a prominent lawyer at Ottawa,
Illinois. We shall not attempt to give
sketches of the various descendants of Mrs.
Munson, as it would expand too much the limits
of this volume.</p>

<p>The shock of the massacre and subsequent
captivity impaired the splendid constitution of
Mrs. Munson, who thereafter suffered from nervousness;
but through the earlier part of her
life, she manifested unusual vigor. As Mrs.
Munson passed middle life she failed rapidly,
and on May 1, 1870, she closed her earthly
career and was laid to rest in the garden beside
her infant children who had gone before her,
and when Mr. Munson died he was interred beside
his faithful wife. Their graves are about
one and one-half miles east of Shabona Park,
on the original Hall homestead.

<p class="caption">BURIAL PLACE OF RACHEL AND HUSBAND.</p>
</div>

<p>Incidentally, we noted the fact that for a
short spell the Hall girls made their home at
the residence of Rev. Robert Horn. He had a
young son, William S., who was studying for
the ministry, and as both belonged to the same
church (Methodist) and were born in Kentucky,
we cannot say that the unexpected
happened. He was one year younger than Sylvia.
The love story of these young people
would gratify any novel writer. When Sylvia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
left with her sister to make her home with her
brother John, she and Mr. Horn looked upon
each other with great affection. The marriage
of Rachel emphasized the yearnings of Sylvia
for her own home, and May 5, 1833, she was
married to Mr. Horn and settled in Cass County,
Illinois. There were born to Mr. and Mrs. Horn,
eleven children. Mr. Horn’s vocation called
him from one place to another. Having served
in the ministry in Illinois, he first went to Missouri,
thence to Peru, Nebraska, next to a parish
near Lincoln, and finally settled down at
Auburn, Nemaha County, Nebraska, where he
died May 8, 1888, leaving him surviving, his
widow, Mrs. Sylvia Hall Horn, and several
children and grand-children.</p>

<p>Mr. Horn became an elder of the M. E. Episcopal
church, and held several high church offices.
Elder Horn was noted for his intense
religious zeal, and, figuratively speaking, he
died in the harness of exhaustion and old age.
He was buried in Mt. Vernon Cemetery, Peru,
Nebraska.</p>

<p>After the death of Elder Horn, Mrs. Sylvia
Hall Horn made her home with her son, Thomas
S. Horn, in Auburn, Nebraska, where she died
January 11, 1899, aged 85 years, 10 months and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
16 days. Mrs. Horn was buried beside her husband
with whom she had happily lived for 55
years. She left surviving her a host of descendants.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1867, John W. Hall, Mrs. Munson,
and her husband, made a visit to Elder
Horn’s, Auburn, Nebraska, during which Mr.
Hall and his sisters narrated the incidents of
the massacre and captivity, which were reduced
to writing by the Elder and published. The
manuscripts are now in the custody of Mrs.
Eckels of Chicago. In his statement Mr. Hall
says: “After thirty-five years of toil have
passed over my head since the memorable occasion,
my memory is in some things rather dim.”
Mrs. Munson and Mrs. Horn close their recital
as follows: “Thus we have given the circumstances
of our captivity and the rescue as nearly
as we can recollect at this date, September 7,
1867.” The former published statements of
the ladies substantially agree with this last
one. All their statements and public interviews
have been freely used and completely worked
into this narrative.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

Munson and Mrs. Horn, 160 acres of land that
the United States had given to the state towards
the construction of the canal between

was not valuable, and netted but a small sum
to the ladies. Now that land is within the city

<p>It has been asserted&mdash;and published in books,
that Congress voted gifts of money to the girls;

It is a graceful shaft.</p>

<p>In 1905, through the efforts of friends of the

on May 21st, 1832, the Illinois legislature appropriated
the sum of five thousand dollars to
place a monument at the grave where the victims
were buried.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> On August 29, 1906, the

who were planting corn south of the Davis cottage
on that day, and who with John W. Hall

This chief’s name is spelled in many different
ways, to-wit: “Sha-bom-ri,” in Smith’s History of
Wisconsin; “Shah-bee-nay,” by Mrs. Kinzie in Wau-Bun;
“Shaubena,” by Matson; “Shau-be-nee,” by
Kingston; “Chab-on-eh,” “Shab-eh-ney,” “Shabonee,”
and “Shaubena,” in the Appleton’s Encyclopedia of
American Biographies, and on his tombstone his
name is spelled “Shabona”. In Illinois, places named
after him are spelled Shabbona and Shabonier, the
latter being the French spelling. As Mr. Smith, Mrs.
Kinzie, Mr. Matson, and Mr. Kingston, knew Shabona
well, the weight of evidence seems to be in
favor of spelling his name Shaubena, which is in
accordance with the spelling of Indian words. The
second <i>b</i> is not heard in the usual pronounciation of
“Shabbona” (Shab‘-eh-ney), and it causes strangers
to mispronounce the name. Even the word “Sac”,
is usually pronounced Sauk, and is generally spelled
Sauk. Very many Indian names have the diphthong
<i>au</i> as shown by names of rivers and places. Consequently,
it would seem that the first syllable should
be spelled S-h-a-u-b.</p></div>

<p>The story of the Hall girls’ adventures would
not be properly finished without some further
mention of Chief Shabona. Probably no other
Indian in the West knew more white people,
individually, than he knew; also, he was known
at sight to more white people than was any
other chief of his time. His name was so familiar
among the whites, that its mere mention was
a safe passport to any home of the settlers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Shabona was well aware of that fact and he
always introduced himself as “Mr. Shabona.”</p>

<p>Baldwin says that Shabona was born in
Canada; but Matson asserts that he was born on
the Kankakee in Will County, Illinois; and the
“Handbook of American Indians” gives Maumee
River, Illinois, as his birthplace. This contention
of many countries as the place of Shabona’s
birth, proves the greatness of the man.
Argos, Rhodes, Smyrna, Chios, Colophon, and
several other cities, claim to be the birthplace
of Homer; and Scotland, England, Wales, and
Brittany, of St. Patrick. Authors agree that
Shabona was born in 1775 and dwelt at Shabona’s
Grove for fifty years. He was a grand-nephew
of Pontiac and his father who was an
Ottawa chief, fought under Pontiac. Shabona
was six feet tall, erect, and weighed over two
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>During the wars of 1812, 1827 and 1832,
Shabona rendered great services to the white
people by saving the lives of many of them who
were taken captives by the Indians, and by protecting
the home of John Kinzie and his friends
during the Chicago massacre. However, with
his tribe he joined in the border war against
the whites and fought beside Tecumseh when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
he fell at the battle of the Thames. That was
the last time that Shabona raised a hand against
the white people.</p>

<p>When Col. Richard M. Johnson, who commanded
the American army at the Thames became
vice-president of the United States, Shabona
made a visit to him at Washington. The
vice-president gave Shabona a heavy gold ring,
which he wore until his death and at his request
it was buried with him.</p>

<p>On account of Shabona’s great services to the
white people, the state of Illinois gave him two
and one-half sections of land at the site of his
Paw-Paw Village. In 1837 the last of Shabona’s
tribe having been moved to a Kansas
reservation, he followed them with his family
consisting of twenty-seven persons, including
his son Pypagee and nephew Pyps who were
soon thereafter slain by the Sacs for the parts
that they played in notifying the whites to flee
to Ottawa, before the massacre at Indian Creek.
Shabona was warned that the Sacs were scheming
to assassinate him, because of his efforts to
save the whites, and in 1855 he returned to
Illinois.</p>

<p>Before Shabona left Illinois for Kansas, he
placed his lands in the hands of an agent named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Norton to collect the rents, pay the taxes and
to look after them generally. Unconscionable
settlers squatted on Shabona’s lands and filed
in the government land office, affidavits that
Shabona had abandoned the lands, and on that
proof and some technicalities the lands were
again sold as public lands, and on Shabona’s
return he found his domain in the possession
of the squatters who claimed to be the owners.
Shabona could not help feeling that he had been
cheated by the whites, after all he had done for
them, and the old man sat on a log near where
his village had formerly stood and wept
bitterly.</p>

<span class="i0">Makes countless thousands mourn!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Shortly after his return, as Shabona was cutting
a few poles to erect a tent on the margin
of the grove that bore his name, a settler attacked
him and forcibly drove him off the land,
and shamefully abused the old man. Then for
some time homeless, he wandered about from
place to place, the few remaining whites whom
he had befriended, always giving him a warm
welcome. The old warrior’s plight aroused the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
dormant gratitude of a few whites who raised
a fund with which they bought for him at Seneca,
on Mazon Creek, near the Illinois River,
twenty acres of land which they cultivated and
erected a dwelling-house thereon. Because of
his natural desire to live out-doors, Shabona
lived in a tent nearby and used the cottage for
storage purposes. Through the efforts of his
friends, the government granted him a pension
of two hundred dollars a year, on which he subsisted
until he died in 1859, at the age of eighty-four
years, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery,
at Morris, Illinois.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>When Shabona was dying, he said: “I want
no monument erected to my memory; my life
has been mark enough for me.” However, his
friends erected at his grave a granite boulder
five feet long by three feet high, which bears
only this simple inscription: “Shabona, 1775-1859.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

Park.”</p>

<span class="large">CO-MEE AND TO-QUA-MEE.</span></h2>

<p>Some of our readers may ask, Was anyone
prosecuted for the massacre at Indian Creek?
Oh, yes! Co-mee and To-qua-mee who had tried
to buy Rachel and Sylvia Hall from their father,
as related in Chapter III., were, in the spring
of 1833, at Ottawa, Illinois, indicted by a grand
jury, and a warrant issued and placed in the
hands of Sheriff George E. Walker who had
been an Indian trader and spoke the Pottawatomie
language, to make the arrests. The Indians
had gone to Iowa with Black Hawk and
had become members of his tribe.</p>

<p>Alone, Sheriff Walker went to the Sac reservation
and placed the Indians under arrest.
The two Indians made no resistance, but unshackled
accompanied the sheriff to Ottawa.
They were allowed to go on a bond signed by
themselves, Shabona, and several other Indians,
upon their promises upon their honor to
return for trial.</p>

<p>When the time for the trial arrived the Indians
were on hand, although they had told
their friends that they expected to be executed.
Many of the friends of the people who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
massacred, armed and threatening to shoot the
prisoners, if they should be liberated, attended
the trial. There was no jail in Ottawa at the
time, so the trial was held under a great tree
on the bank of the Illinois. All through the
trial the sheriff with a posse of armed men,
guarded the Indians.</p>

<p>Mrs. Munson and Mrs. Horn, the principal
witnesses, could not positively identify either
of the Indians, and as the Indians had voluntarily
stood their trial when they might have
escaped, the jury acquitted them. When the
trial was over the Indians’ friends gave them a
banquet at Buffalo Rock (six miles down the
Illinois), to which the sheriff and several other
prominent men of the time were invited. A
fat deer and choice game were parts of the
menu, and a great red-white pow-wow was a
part of the celebration.</p>

<p>It is said that subsequently when To-qua-mee
and Co-mee were drinking with their friends,
they admitted that they were present at the
massacre, and that they took part in it only
because they were angered at Davis for building
the dam across Indian Creek. Also, they
stated that it was through their influence that
the lives of the Hall girls were spared, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
was an express condition upon which they insisted
before they would take part in the massacre.
However, Black Hawk in his autobiography
states that it was the Sac Indians who
saved the lives of the girls; and White Crow in
his speech at Morrison’s, said that the Sacs intended
to kill the girls and that the Winnebagoes
saved their lives.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
